# Architecture — monster-realm

The durable design record (links the ADRs in `docs/adr/`; not a milestone
narrative). The spec corpus is the source of truth; this records the shape.

## The spine (load-bearing, do not "simplify")

**Functional core / imperative shell with server authority.** One pure rule layer
(`game-core`); the server module, the wasm boundary, and the client are the
effectful shells.

- **`game-core`** — pure, deterministic Rust. Every game rule lives here exactly
  once (ADR-0003 SSOT). The server runs it for truth; the client runs the *same
  compiled code* (via `client-wasm`) for prediction. Re-implementing a rule
  elsewhere is the desync bug. Determinism is mechanically enforced: `clippy.toml`
  bans wall-clock reads + unseeded RNG workspace-wide; time/RNG are injected.
- **`client-wasm`** — thin `wasm-bindgen` exports wrapping `game-core` for client
  prediction (ADR-0036). Built with `wasm-pack`. Depends on `game-core` **without**
  the `spacetimedb` feature (the feature-isolation eval proves it).
- **`server-module`** — the SpacetimeDB module (crate 1.12 / CLI 2.6). Reducers are
  THIN: validate `ctx.sender` + legality → delegate to `game-core` → write tables;
  reject with `Err`, never clamp. Shared types flatten into table columns.
- **`sim-harness`** — headless, deterministic, multi-client driver (injected
  clock + seed) with a seeded netcode `Link` (latency/loss/reorder) for in-CI
  netcode tests without a browser.
- **`client/`** — PixiJS + TS: connects, subscribes, renders from the **generated**
  bindings (never duplicated content). Read-only store + one-way flow (ADR-0014).
- **prediction layer** (`client/src/`, M3) — the headless, node-testable core M4's
  loop consumes. `convert/` marshals SDK shapes (tagged-union enums, `bigint` ids)
  ↔ the wasm/serde shapes, dumb + explicit (no abstraction across the boundary), incl.
  the **lossy local-time rebasing** baseline (no clock sync, ADR-0012). `prediction/`
  is the **`Predictor`**: a local intent queue + `pending` **queue-ops** (`Enqueue`/
  `SetMove`/`Clear`, not raw moves) + the four-step `reconcile` (drop acked → rebuild
  from the server queue + replay ops → reset to truth → `step_ms`-paced `drain`) + a
  divergence return; seeded by the first own-row; bounded prediction + snap-on-large-
  gap (ADR-0013). The movement rule itself never lives here — `apply_move` is the
  injected client-wasm export (proven by the parity + no-logic evals).
  **M4 contract:** the own character animates from a **self-owned slide clock** and
  **ignores `move_started_at`** (drain-pacing bookkeeping only); `reconcile` runs on
  one **transaction-consistent** snapshot.
- **render layer** (`client/src/render/`, M4b) — the renderer's functional core +
  thin Pixi shell. Pure, node-tested: `map` (the tile map parsed ONCE from the wasm
  `zone_map()` value, never a hard-coded TS grid — visual-SSOT), `interpolation` (the
  remote delay buffer — render at `now − interpDelay` between the two bracketing
  snapshots, **hold-not-extrapolate**), `slideClock` (the own character's self-owned
  slide, keyed to target-tile changes, **decoupled from `move_started_at`**), `zorder`
  (stable overlap order), `viewRegistry` (pooled-view create/teardown). The Pixi shell
  (`world`/`characterView`/`placeholderAssets`, no pixel tests — validated by the M5
  e2e) draws `TILE_PX`-scaled tiles + one **pooled** sprite per entity (mutate-in-place,
  torn down on despawn), behind an **`AssetProvider`** seam (albedo today; HD-2D
  normal/material channels are an additive future render mode — ADR-0004). It owns no
  state and reads no store/predictor: the M4c loop feeds it resolved positions
  (own from the slide clock, remote from the interpolation buffer).

## Mechanical gates (each ships a proof-of-teeth fixture — ADR-0010)

`just ci` is green **and meaningful**: determinism/safety (clippy), feature-
isolation, prediction-parity (native == wasm-pack, incl. movement), **no-logic-in-
wrapper** (client-wasm marshals, never re-decides the rule) and **js-path-parity**
(the marshaled serde `apply_move` == the native-verified flat path, M3),
netcode-determinism, zoned-schema (every world table carries an indexed
`zone_id`, ADR-0007), append-only content ids (ADR-0006), bindings-drift
(committed bindings == fresh `spacetime generate`, ADR-0009). Each gate has a
known-bad fixture it must reject. The **client TS** is gated too (M3): `tsc` +
vitest/fast-check over the convert + Predictor property suites (run in `just ci`
and CI on a Node setup).

## Schema & content (ADR-0006)

Additive-only schema; content is **data** (RON registries in `game-core/content`,
parsed by pure loaders) seeded by an idempotent `sync_content` reducer (upsert by
stable id), separate from `init`. Stable ids are append-only.

## Decisions

See `docs/adr/` (0002–0034 design ADRs from the spec corpus; 0035 scaffold
hardening, 0036 wasm boundary, 0037 STDB/content deps, 0038 proptest) and
`docs/validation-findings.md` (empirical Tier-1 results).

## Status

Phase A spine: M0 (foundation + gates + presence walking skeleton, e2e green),
M1 (movement core), M2 (authoritative zoned movement + per-zone tick), and M3
(the prediction layer — client-wasm marshaling bridge + convert + the Predictor)
complete. **M4a** (the connection adapter + `AuthoritativeStore`) and **M4b** (the
render layer — tile map from `zone_map()`, pooled CharacterViews, the own-character
slide clock + remote interpolation buffer + stable z-order, behind tested pure cores
with proof-of-teeth) complete; **M4c** (the per-frame loop wiring own-from-predictor /
remote-from-buffer + the debug HUD / `window.__game()`) and the M5 two-window e2e are next.
Deferred-with-rationale: the criterion **perf-budget gate** (folded into the M20
observability capstone — a non-flaky budget needs tuned baselines) and GitHub
Actions *execution* (the workflow is committed; only local `just ci` is verifiable
in this environment).

### Finalization audit (2026-06-25) — named deferrals

A read-only review of M0–M3 + M4a found **no correctness/security issues** (rule
SSOT single-homed, reducers gate on `ctx.sender` + reject-not-clamp, the parity /
no-logic / desync evals all bite). Hardened in the pass: a `debug_assert` guard on
the server `zone_map` (fails loud if a non-zero zone ticks before M11), a content
test pinning the `zone_0` placeholder map within its registry dims, a `drain`
cleanup, and a predictor-level **monotonic-prediction** smoothness test. Tracked so
they stay conscious, not forgotten:

- **`isWasmReady()`** — M3 shipped the bridge + Vite plugin config; the readiness
  gate lands in **M4** with the live `--target bundler` load (the loop awaits it).
- **Renderer smoothness evals** (own slide-clock decoupling from `move_started_at`;
  remote interpolation-buffer jitter) — **delivered in M4b** as vitest proof-of-teeth
  (`render/slideClock.test.ts`, `render/interpolation.test.ts`: the bad clock that
  reads `move_started_at` stutters; the no-buffer renderer double-jumps). The
  standalone `evals/*.eval.mjs` smoothness gates ride with the M4c loop (which
  resolves own-from-predictor / remote-from-buffer end-to-end).
- **`seq` boundary helper** (`u64` reducer / `bigint` store ↔ the predictor's session
  `number`) — a typed conversion lands with the **M5** connection adapter; both sides
  are internally consistent today.
- **Spec path `frontend/` == delivered `client/`** — gates target `client/`; the spec
  prose is stale (cosmetic).
- **M2 spec items not yet gated** (a `client_connected` reducer, a schema-snapshot /
  migration-smoke eval, soak/load tests) — soak/load is the **M20** capstone; the rest
  carry forward with M2's 9 shipped proof-of-teeth evals as the live gate set.
