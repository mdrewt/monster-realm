# Architecture — monster-realm

The durable design record (links the ADRs in `docs/adr/`; not a milestone
narrative). The spec corpus is the source of truth; this records the shape.

## The spine (load-bearing, do not "simplify")

**Functional core / imperative shell with server authority.** One pure rule layer
(`game-core`); the server module, the wasm boundary, and the client are the
effectful shells.

- **`game-core`** — pure, deterministic Rust. Every game rule lives here exactly
  once (ADR-0003 SSOT). The server runs it for truth; the client runs the *same
  compiled code* (via `client-wasm`) for prediction. Re-implementing a rule
  elsewhere is the desync bug. Determinism is mechanically enforced: `clippy.toml`
  bans wall-clock reads + unseeded RNG workspace-wide; time/RNG are injected.
- **`client-wasm`** — thin `wasm-bindgen` exports wrapping `game-core` for client
  prediction (ADR-0036). Built with `wasm-pack`. Depends on `game-core` **without**
  the `spacetimedb` feature (the feature-isolation eval proves it).
- **`server-module`** — the SpacetimeDB module (crate 1.12 / CLI 2.6). Reducers are
  THIN: validate `ctx.sender` + legality → delegate to `game-core` → write tables;
  reject with `Err`, never clamp. Shared types flatten into table columns.
- **`sim-harness`** — headless, deterministic, multi-client driver (injected
  clock + seed) with a seeded netcode `Link` (latency/loss/reorder) for in-CI
  netcode tests without a browser.
- **`client/`** — PixiJS + TS: connects, subscribes, renders from the **generated**
  bindings (never duplicated content). Read-only store + one-way flow (ADR-0014).

## Mechanical gates (each ships a proof-of-teeth fixture — ADR-0010)

`just ci` is green **and meaningful**: determinism/safety (clippy), feature-
isolation, prediction-parity (native == wasm-pack, incl. movement),
netcode-determinism, zoned-schema (every world table carries an indexed
`zone_id`, ADR-0007), append-only content ids (ADR-0006), bindings-drift
(committed bindings == fresh `spacetime generate`, ADR-0009). Each gate has a
known-bad fixture it must reject.

## Schema & content (ADR-0006)

Additive-only schema; content is **data** (RON registries in `game-core/content`,
parsed by pure loaders) seeded by an idempotent `sync_content` reducer (upsert by
stable id), separate from `init`. Stable ids are append-only.

## Decisions

See `docs/adr/` (0002–0034 design ADRs from the spec corpus; 0035 scaffold
hardening, 0036 wasm boundary, 0037 STDB/content deps, 0038 proptest) and
`docs/validation-findings.md` (empirical Tier-1 results).

## Status

Phase A spine: M0 (foundation + gates + presence walking skeleton, e2e green) and
M1 (movement core) complete. M2 (server move-queue + per-zone tick) is next.
Deferred-with-rationale: the criterion **perf-budget gate** (folded into the M20
observability capstone — a non-flaky budget needs tuned baselines) and GitHub
Actions *execution* (the workflow is committed; only local `just ci` is verifiable
in this environment).
